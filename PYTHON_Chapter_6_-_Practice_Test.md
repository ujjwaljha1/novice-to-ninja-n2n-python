# ğŸ“š Questions for ID: 5bad1b2aa2da6b25b98780d1

## :question: Question 1 (Order: 1)

<p>Write a program to defineÂ a class as Temprature which contains two methods asÂ celseiusToFahren() andÂ fahrenToCelseius() Â as below and display the output by creating its object and calling itsÂ methods. TheÂ first method takes 10 degree celsius and the second method takes 100 degreeÂ fahrenheit as an input.</p>
<p>1) The celseiusToFahren() method, which takesÂ celsius value, converts itÂ into fahrenheit andÂ print resultedÂ fahrenheit value upto 1 decimal point (eg. 50.0).</p>
<p>2) The fahrenToCelseius() method,which takesÂ fahrenheit value, converts itÂ into celsius andÂ print resultedÂ celsius value upto 1 decimal pointÂ (eg. 50.0).</p>
<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Formula of<strong>Â </strong>Â FahrenheitÂ = (celsius * Â 9.0 / 5.0 ) + 32</p>


### ğŸ’» Solution (python):

```python
class Temperature():
  def celseiusToFahren(self, celsius):
    self.celsius = float(celsius)
    self.fahren = (celsius *  9.0 / 5.0 ) + 32
    print("%.1f"%(self.fahren))
  def fahrenToCelseius(self, fahren):
    self.fahren = fahren
    self.celsius = (fahren - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0
    print("%.1f"%(self.celsius))
    
temp = Temperature()
temp.celseiusToFahren(10)
temp.fahrenToCelseius(100)
```
