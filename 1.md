## :question: Question 1 (Order: 1)

<p><u><strong>Python Operators</strong></u><br/>
The basic symbols like (+,-,*,/ etc) used to perform mathematical operations are called operators.</p>
<p>Operators tell python what to do with the numbers surrounding them. The plus sign(+) adds numbers, the minus sign (-) subtracts numbers, the asterisk (*) multiplies numbers, and the slash (/) divides numbers.Â </p>
<p>We can use python shell to perform mathematical calculations like 5 + 6, 6 / 2 etc.</p>
<p>For example, if add two numbers as 300 and 100, the output code would be "print(300 + 100)" and output will be 400.Â </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Python use print function to display the content.</p>
<p><strong>Question:Â </strong>Write a program to print the following mathematical operations in different lines.<br/>
1. Add 200 and 300<br/>
2. Divide 250 by 50<br/>
3. Subtract 100 from 500<br/>
4. Product of '<strong>a'</strong>Â and 50<strong>Â </strong>,where '<strong>a'Â </strong>is a keyboard input</p>


### ðŸ’» Solution (python):

```python
a=int(input())
print(200 + 300)
print(250 / 50)
print(500 - 100)
print(a * 50)
```

## :question: Question 2 (Order: 2)

<p><u><strong>Evaluating Expressions</strong></u><br/>
Expressions are made up of values (the numbers) connected by operators (the math signs) that produce a new value.</p>
<p>For example, 10 + 30 is an expression where values 10 and 30 are connected by an operator â€˜ + â€˜.</p>
<p>When a computer solves the expression 10 + 30 and returns the value 40, it has evaluated the expression.</p>
<p>Evaluating an expression reduces the expression to a single value, just like solving a math problem reduces the problem to a single number.</p>
<p>When python evaluates an expression, it has an order of precedence in which these are going to be calculated.</p>
<p>The rules of evaluating an expression are follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) Multiplication and division always go before addition and subtraction.</li>
<li>2) We use parentheses to control the order of operations.</li>
<li>3) Parts of the expression inside parentheses are evaluated first.</li>
<li>4) Parentheses can be nested, which means that there can be parentheses inside parentheses.</li>
<li>5) Python evaluates the innermost parentheses first, then the outer ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example,an expression 7 + 6 * 2 + 4 evaluates to 23 because 6 Â * 2 (=12) is evaluated first and then do addition 7+12+4(=23).</p>
<p>An expression (7 + 6) * (2 + 4) evaluates to 78 because the (7 + 6) and (2 + 4) inside parentheses are evaluated before multiplication so (7 + 6)=13 and (2 + 4)=6 and then 13*6=78.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Write a program to print the result of the following statement.</p>
<p>Add 10 to 8, then Multiply the result by 2, then subtract 11 from the resultÂ and divide it byÂ <strong>'a'</strong>Â where a is a keyboard input.</p>


### ðŸ’» Solution (python):

```python
a=int(input())
print((((10 + 8) * 2) - 11) / a)
```

## :question: Question 3 (Order: 3)

<p><u><strong>Variables</strong></u></p>
<p>The word variable in programming, describes a place to store information such as numbers, text, lists of numbers, list of texts etc.<br/>
When an expression evaluates to a value, we can use that value later by storing it in a variable.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax to assign a value to a variable:Â </strong></p>
<p>&lt;name of variable&gt; = &lt;value&gt; , where "=" is a assignment operator</p>
<p>For example,Â  price = 500</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Write a program to assign the value '<strong>a'Â </strong>(where '<strong>a'</strong>Â is a keyboard input)Â to the variableÂ 'first', then assign the contents of 'first' to variable 'second' and print the variable 'second'.</p>


### ðŸ’» Solution (python):

```python
a=int(input())
first = a
second = first
print(second)
```

## :question: Question 4 (Order: 4)

<p><u><strong>Naming a variableÂ </strong></u><br/>
In python, all variables and functions name are case sensitive means MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor Â myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing.Â </p>
<p><strong>Rules for naming of variable:Â </strong></p>
<p>1) Variable names can be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore character ( _).</p>
<p>2) They canâ€™t start with a number. we can use anything from single letters (such as a) to long sentences for variable names.</p>
<p>3) A variable canâ€™t contain a space, so use an underscore to separate words.</p>
<p>4) It is not allowed to use keywords as variable name like print, for, while,if etc. keywords of python not used as a variable name because they are used to do some specific function in python program like loop function, condition function etc.</p>
<p>For examples, someVariable = 10, Total_price = 100</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Â  For a given gallon value <strong>G</strong>, write a program toÂ calculate and display the car's MPG by assigning a value 100 toÂ the total number of miles he or she has driven and <strong>G</strong> to the gallons of gas used.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A carâ€™s MPG can be calculated as Car's MPG = miles driven / gallons of gas used</p>


### ðŸ’» Solution (python):

```python
miles_driven = 100
G=int(input())
MPG = miles_driven / G
print(MPG)
```
